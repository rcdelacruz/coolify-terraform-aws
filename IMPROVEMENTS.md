# Coolify Terraform AWS - Improvements and Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements and fixes made to the Coolify Terraform AWS configuration to ensure it works properly and follows best practices.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Variable and Output Definitions**
- **Issue**: Variables and outputs were defined in both `main.tf` and separate `variables.tf`/`outputs.tf` files
- **Fix**: Removed duplicates from `main.tf`, keeping them only in dedicated files
- **Impact**: Terraform initialization now works without errors

### 2. **Missing Elastic IP Configuration**
- **Issue**: README mentioned Elastic IP costs but no Elastic IP was configured
- **Fix**: Added `aws_eip` and `aws_eip_association` resources
- **Impact**: Server now has a static public IP address, preventing IP changes on restart

### 3. **Inconsistent Variable Usage**
- **Issue**: Variables defined in `variables.tf` but not used in `main.tf`
- **Fix**: Updated resources to use variables consistently:
  - `var.data_volume_size` for EBS volume size
  - `var.root_volume_size` for root volume size
  - `var.enable_termination_protection` for instance protection
  - `var.project_name` and `var.environment` for resource naming

### 4. **Improved Resource Tagging**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent and minimal resource tagging
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive tags to all resources:
  - `Name`: Descriptive name with project and environment
  - `Project`: Project identifier
  - `Environment`: Environment identifier
  - `Purpose`: Resource purpose (for S3 bucket)

### 5. **EBS Volume Device Detection**
- **Issue**: Hard-coded device name might not work on all ARM instances
- **Fix**: Enhanced user_data.sh script to detect correct device name:
  - Checks for both `/dev/nvme1n1` and `/dev/nvme2n1`
  - Includes error handling if device not found
  - Checks if device is already formatted before formatting

### 6. **Backup Script Environment Variables**
- **Issue**: Backup script missing required environment variables
- **Fix**: Updated backup script to include:
  - `BUCKET_NAME` and `REGION` variables from Terraform
  - Proper variable escaping in heredoc
  - Region specification in AWS CLI commands

### 7. **Health Check Improvements**
- **Issue**: Health check endpoint `/api/health` may not exist in Coolify
- **Fix**: Updated health check to:
  - Check if Coolify containers are running
  - Use basic HTTP check to port 8000
  - Restart using docker compose instead of systemctl

### 8. **S3 Lifecycle Configuration**
- **Issue**: Missing required filter attribute in lifecycle rule
- **Fix**: Added empty prefix filter to lifecycle configuration

### 9. **Resource Naming Consistency**
- **Issue**: Hard-coded resource names
- **Fix**: Updated all resource names to use project and environment variables:
  - VPC: `${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-vpc`
  - Security Group: `coolify-sg` (kept for clarity)
  - S3 Bucket: `${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-backups-${random_id}`

## New Features Added

### 1. **Validation Script**
- Created `terraform/validate.sh` for pre-deployment validation
- Checks:
  - Required tools (Terraform, AWS CLI)
  - AWS credentials and permissions
  - Key pair existence
  - Terraform configuration validity
  - Security recommendations

### 2. **Enhanced Outputs**
- Added `elastic_ip_id` output for reference
- Updated all IP-related outputs to use Elastic IP
- Improved output descriptions

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Enhanced user_data.sh with better error handling
- Added device detection logic for EBS volumes
- Improved logging and status reporting

## Security Improvements

### 1. **Resource Tagging**
- All resources now properly tagged for better governance
- Easier cost tracking and resource management

### 2. **Validation Checks**
- Pre-deployment validation of security settings
- Warnings for overly permissive CIDR blocks

### 3. **Consistent Configuration**
- All variables properly defined and used
- No hard-coded values that could cause issues

## Cost Optimization

### 1. **Proper Resource Sizing**
- Variables for volume sizes allow easy adjustment
- Default values optimized for cost vs. performance

### 2. **S3 Lifecycle Management**
- Proper lifecycle rules for backup retention
- Automatic cleanup of old versions

## Testing and Validation

### 1. **Terraform Validation**
- ✅ `terraform fmt -check` passes
- ✅ `terraform init` succeeds
- ✅ `terraform validate` passes
- ✅ No syntax errors or warnings

### 2. **Configuration Consistency**
- ✅ All variables defined and used consistently
- ✅ No duplicate definitions
- ✅ Proper resource dependencies

## Next Steps

### 1. **Before Deployment**
1. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`
2. Update variables with your specific values:
   - `key_name`: Your EC2 key pair name
   - `allowed_cidrs`: Your IP address for security
   - `region` and `availability_zone`: Your preferred AWS region
3. Run `./validate.sh` to check configuration
4. Review and apply with `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`

### 2. **After Deployment**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for Coolify installation to complete
2. Access Coolify at the provided URL
3. Configure Cloudflare Tunnel using the provided instructions
4. Set up monitoring and alerts as needed

### 3. **Ongoing Maintenance**
1. Regular backups are automated
2. System updates run weekly
3. Monitor CloudWatch metrics
4. Review security settings periodically

## Conclusion

The Coolify Terraform AWS configuration is now production-ready with:
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Consistent variable usage and resource naming
- ✅ Enhanced security and monitoring
- ✅ Automated backups and maintenance
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and validation tools

The configuration should deploy successfully and provide a robust, scalable Coolify installation on AWS.
